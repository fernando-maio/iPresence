# iPresence Tech Test

*** REST API that, given a famous person and a count N, returns N quotes from this famous person shouted.

For this project, I used the technologies below:
- Composer: To start a project and manage the paths;
- Slim 4: To resolve routes;
- Predis: To save and to consulting the cache data;
- PHPUnit: To unit tests.

I putted some comments inside the code to have a better comprehention.

Thank you for the opportunity. If you need anything else, please, let me know!
